# Unbeatable-TICTACTOE-AI
The AI uses an algorithm called minimax, which evaluates all possible positions in the game, and chooses the best decision, which aims to minimize the possible gain from the human player. In this case, it's getting a winning combination for a tic tac toe board.
The AI itself was made in javascript.

Features:
  - Has a replay button, so you can keep playing without refreshing the page
  - Changes color of the tic tac toe board if you win, tie or lose
  - Displays text saying if you won, lost or tied.
  - Comments in javascript file that tells you how this AI works
